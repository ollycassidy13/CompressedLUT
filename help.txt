This program generates source code  for  univariate  functions.  It 
works by the user specifing  a  text  file  that 
contains the values of a lookup table specifying  f(x)  for  all  x 
values

Lookup table as a text File -->  Please  specify  the  following 
   arguments:
	-table (string)		: path of  the  table,   in   which 
	                          each   line    has    a    single   
	                          hexadecimal value. The table size 
	                          must be a power of 2.  The  input
	                          and   output   bit   width    are 
	                          determined  based  on  the  table 
	                          size  and  the  maximum  absolute    
	                          value of the table, respectively.

The following optional arguments can be used in either mode.
	-name (string)		: output table and file name.
	-output (string)	: output folder for  the  generated
	                          files. The  folder  must  already 
	                          exist.                     
	-mdbw (int)		: minimum decomposition bit  width. 
	                          The default value is 2. 
	-hbs (0/1)		: higher-bit  split.  The   default 
	                          value is 1 (0=no, 1=yes). 
	-ssc (0/1)		: self-similarity compression.  The 
	                          default value is 1. 
	-mlc (0/1)		: multi-level   compression.    The 
	                          default value is 1.
